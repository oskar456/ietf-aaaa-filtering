    title: Chrome Host Resolution - IPv6 and connectivity

...

--- abstract

Since IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are represented by different resource records in
the Domain Name System, operating systems capable of running both IPv4 and IPv6 need to execute
two queries when resolving a host name. This document discusses the conditions under
which a stub resolver can optimize the process by not sending one of the
queries if the host is connected to a single-stack network.

# Introduction

Most operating systems support both the IPv6 and the IPv4 networking stack. When such a
host is connected to a dual-stack network, whenever a process requests
resolution of a DNS name, two DNS queries need to be issued - one for an A
record representing an IPv4 address, and one for a AAAA record representing an IPv6
address. The results of such queries are then merged and ordered based on
[RFC6724] or used as input for the Happy Eyeballs algorithm [RFC8305].

When such a host is connected to a single-stack network, only one DNS query
needs to be performed: there is no reason for querying for a AAAA record if the
host has no IPv6 connectivity, the same way there is no reason to look for an A
record if the host has no IPv4 connectivity. Such an optimization however has to
consider any possible means of obtaining connectivity for a particular address
family, including but not limited to IPv6 Transition Mechanisms or VPNs.

Please note that Multicast DNS [RFC6762] or similar link-local name resolution
protocols are not considered in scope of this document.

# Connectivity detection algorithms

Whenever an application asks the stub resolver to resolve a domain name without
specifying the address family, the stub resolver follows one of the algorithms
specified below:

## Routing table based algorithm

This algorithm assumes that the host has connectivity of particular address
family if there is at least one route to a destination that is not in Link-Local
address space. If there are only routes for destinations in the Link-Local
address space, the host is not able to send any packets towards any destination
address that could be possibly obtained from the DNS. Therefore, sending an
address query for that particular address family is unnecessary.

For each address family supported by the operating system:

 1. Read the routing table of the address family;
 2. Remove all the routes towards Link-Local destinations from the routing table, ie.:
    * remove routes towards addresses from Section 2.5.6 of [RFC4291] from the IPv6 routing table
    * remove routes towards addresses from [RFC3927] from the IPv4 routing table
 3. If the routing table is not empty, send the corresponding name query to the DNS:
    * AAAA query for IPv6
    * A query for IPv4

## IP address based algorithm

As an alternative to analyzing the routing tables, the stub resolver might
choose to determine the connectivity by looking at the addresses configured on
all network interfaces. This is similar to an application using the flag
`AI_ADDRCONFIG` when interacting with the stub resolver using `getaddrinfo()`
function [GAI].

For each address family supported by the operating system:

 1. Collect all addresses configured on all interfaces
 2. Remove all Link-Local addresses from the list, ie.:
    * remove addresses from Section 2.5.6 of [RFC4291] from the list of IPv6 addresses
    * remove addresses from [RFC3927] from the list of IPv4 addresses
 3. If the list of addresses is not empty, send the corresponding name query to the DNS:
    * AAAA query for IPv6
    * A query for IPv4

# Connectivity detection considerations

When detecting the connectivity presence, it is necessary to consider ANY routes
towards non Link-Local address space and/or IP addresses on ALL interfaces and
not just the default route and/or just the default network interface. The
implementations SHOULD NOT try to determine connectivity by hardcoding a
particular publicly reachable IP address [CHROME].

Improper detection can cause issues for:

 * private networks without reachability to the Internet
 * VPN tunnels using different address family than the native address
   family of the host, providing possibly only a limited subset of routes
   (split-mode VPN)

# Filtering DNS results

If the host does not have full connectivity for both address families (there
are no default gateways for both IPv4 and IPv6), it is possible that the IP(v6)
address obtained from the DNS falls into the address space not covered by a
route. This should not be problem for a properly written application, since
[RFC6724] requires applications to try connecting to all addresses received from
the stub resolver.

However, in order to minimize the impact on poorly designed applications, the stub
resolver MAY remove addresses not covered by an entry in the routing table from
the list of DNS query results sent to the application.

## Filtering IPv4-mapped addresses

As an extension to the filtering of DNS results, the stub resolver MAY also
remove IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (Section 2.5.5.2 of [RFC4291]) from the list of DNS
query results sent to the application.

IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are not valid destination addresses [IANA],
therefore they should never appear in AAAA records. Sending IPv4-mapped IPv6
address to the application might cause address family confusion for applications
using IPv4 compatibility of IPv6 sockets [RFC3493].

# Effects of not doing address record filtering

The optimization described above is OPTIONAL. A stub resolver of a dual-stack
capable host can always issue both A and AAAA queries to the DNS, merge and
order the results and send them to the application even if it has only
single-stack connectivity. Sending packets to a destination not covered by an
entry in the routing table will be immediately refused, so a properly written
application will quickly iterate through the list of addresses and finally
select the one using the same address family as the connectivity of the host.

However, it should be noted that such behavior increases load on the DNS system.
If such an optimization is removed (for instance by a software update) on a
large single-stack network, this might overload parts of the DNS
infrastructure, since the number of queries will double.

# Security Considerations

Reducing the number of queries allows an attacker observing the DNS traffic to
figure out which address families the host uses.

Suddendly disabling the optimization can overload parts of the DNS
infrastructure due to doubling the number of queries.
